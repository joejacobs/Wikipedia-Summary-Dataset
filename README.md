Wikipedia Summary Dataset
======

This is a dataset that can be used for research into machine learning and natural language processing. It contains all titles and summaries (or introductions) of English Wikipedia articles, extracted in *September of 2017*.

The dataset is different from the regular [Wikipedia dump](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html) and different from the datasets that can be created by [gensim](http://textminingonline.com/training-word2vec-model-on-english-wikipedia-by-gensim) because ours contains the extracted summaries and not the entire unprocessed page body. This could be useful if one wants to use the smaller, more concise, and more definitional summaries in their research. Or if one just wants to use a smaller but still diverse dataset for efficient training with resource constraints.

A summary or introduction of an article is everything starting from the page title up to the content outline.

The raw dataset leaves the original text structure intact. Additionally, we provide pre-processed versions.

Dataset contents
----

The tarbals contain two files. A `.txt` file and a `.vocab` file. The `.txt` file contains all the necessary data. Each line represents an article and contains both a title and a summary separated by `|||`. The lines are ordered by Wikipedia `page_id`. If you want to create a smaller test dataset, I would suggest sampling lines from the file and not splitting it directly.

Example from `tokenized.txt`:

```
Anarchism ||| Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self-governed societies based on voluntaryâ€¦
Autism ||| Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction , impaired verbalâ€¦
Albedo ||| Albedo ( ) is a measure for reflectance or optical brightness ( Latin albedo , `` whiteness '' ) ofâ€¦
â€¦
```

There is also a `.vocab` file which contains the vocabulary and the count of each token. Example from `tokenized.vocab`:

```
, 27222735
the 25505452
. 21555700
of 16267241
in 13313133
and 12630336
a 10202887
is 7770405
â€¦
```

Dataset construction
-----

The dataset was constructed using a script that calls Wikipedia API for every page with their `page_id`. The correct way to construct summaries without any unwanted artifacts is constructing them by using the [TextExtracts](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TextExtracts) extension. So the API call we used, also uses the TextExtracts extension to create the summaries or introductions. As you can imagine, this takes quite a while.

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?format=json&maxlag=5&action=query&prop=extracts&exintro=&explaintext=&pageids=123|456|789
```

The actual downloading is done using `download.py` and stores the raw JSON output of the API in a separate folder. Afterwards the script `process.py` can combine all these API responses into two big files, i.e. a `.txt` file and a `.vocab` file.

Scripts to create the dataset are provided in this [repository](src). They require a local Wikipedia installation and access to its MySQL database filled with data to get the page identifiers (`page_id`). You can fill a MySQL database with the Wikipedia data from the dump using [MWDumper](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-tools-mwdumper).

Additionally, we would ask you not to build the dataset using the official Wikipedia API if this is not needed, since building the dataset would require calling the API for every page and this puts strain on their public API. **Please respect the `maxlag=5` parameter if you use the official API `en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php`.**
